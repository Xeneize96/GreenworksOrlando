# GreenworksOrlando
This is a project I worked on in school with 5 other classmates (Valencia College).

The purpose for this project is to increase sustainability in Orlando.
This map will inform locals about all the environmental initiatives taking place in Orlando.

Frameworks/languages/tools used include:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- MySQL
- Java
- ArcGIS API
- Google Maps
- Tomcat Server
- Maven
- XML
- Microsoft Excel


Note: Due to the ArcGIS API token being expired, the map will be unresponsive. But please take a look at this web app!
